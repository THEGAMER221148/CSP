            <h1>How I've Changed</h1>
            <h2>Comparing myself now to the beginning of the year</h2>
            <p>Almost three months ago, I came into this class for the first time. I had taken CSSE last year, and had some computer science experience, but I had no experience the AP CSP course. <br>
            Before starting this course, I wasn't great at leading. I <i>could</i> be the leader of a group project, but would sometimes get lost or just "go with the flow." However, this class has taught me something valuable - how to take control and work as a team. Now, after going through nearly the entire first trimester, I have developed critical teamworking skills that will undoubtably benifit me in the future. I've also improved my awareness and communication skills, getting better at being "on top of things."</p>
