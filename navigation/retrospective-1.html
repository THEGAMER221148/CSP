            <h1>How I've Changed</h1>
            <h2>Comparing myself now to the beginning of the year</h2>
            <p>Almost three months ago, I came into this class for the first time. I had taken CSSE last year, and had some computer science experience, but I had no experience the AP CSP course. <br>
            Before starting this course, I wasn't great at leading. I <i>could</i> be the leader of a group project, but would sometimes get lost or just "go with the flow." However, this class has taught me something valuable - how to take control and work as a team. Now, after going through nearly the entire first trimester, I have developed critical teamworking skills that will undoubtably benifit me in the future. I've also improved my awareness and communication skills, getting better at being "on top of things."</p>

        <div class="section" id="2" style="visibility: hidden;">
            <h1>Sprints & Key Ideas</h1>
            <h2>Remembering Things from Three Sprints</h2>
            <p><i>(I recognize that there's a lot of text here, so I've highlighted key words to make reading easier)</i></p>
            <p>Throughout the year, we completed three sprints. <br><br>The first one focused on tool installation and a basic introduction of how CSP is taught. Since I took CSSE last year, I alreasy had some experience going into the tools installation and did not have to start from scratch. I already has WSL, Ubuntu, VSCode, and Python installed on my computer, and I had a basic understanding of the linux commands in the terminal. What I mainly learned from that first sprint was more about the Linux terminal, since that was something I needed a little more practice with at the time. <br> 
            <br>The second sprint was where things really picked up. <strong>It was mostly about Javascript and Python</strong>, and although I was already familiar with these programming languages, the topics we covered weren't all things I was experienced in. For instance, algorithmic efficiency was a relatively new topic, as I hadn't known about it for long before I had to build my lesson on it for the class. One of the student-led homeworks involving an API was also challenging as I had never done things like that before. However, most of the material covered was pretty basic stuff that I already had a good understanding of. <br>
            <br>The third and final sprint of the trimester was my favorite one. In sprint 3, we mainly focused on putting our coding experience we gained in sprint 2 to use in the form of a space-themed questified learning experience called Digital Famine. It was here that we created interactive lessons on various computer science and web concepts that all came together to form a fun quest. Having created the lesson about databases, I definitely gained some experience with database security and encryption. We also incoorperated microblogging into our lessons in the form of a feedback discussion board, which was undoubtably a focus of the sprint.</p>

            <h1>My N@TM Experience</h1>
            <h2>How Night at the Museum went this trimester!</h2>
            <p>During this trimester's Night at the Museum event, I presented my level of the class's quest-like learing experience <a href="https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/digital-famine/"><i>Digital Famine</i></a> along with my team. Our presentation went smoothly, and thanks to the microblogging feature, we got some nice comments telling us that we had useful information! <br>
            <br> Another nice thing about N@TM is that I got an opportunity to look at what the other classes created, and safe to say it did not dissapoint! CSSE's <a href="https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/west-coast"><i>West Coast</i></a> project was definitely fun to play learn about.</p>

            <h1>Expanding Digital Famine</h1>
            <h2>"What do you want to do next on project, given time?"</h2>
            <p>If we had more time to work on our section of <i>Digital Famine</i>, we would make the site <strong>easier to navigate</strong> and <strong>less complex</strong> so that those learning from the lesson could have an easier time navigating and understanding the material.</p>

            <h1>Next Steps in CompSci</h1>
            <h2>"What do you want to learn next in CompSci?"</h2>
            <p>While there are many aspects of computer science that I would find interesting, the topics I look forward to learning are <strong>databases, encryption,</strong> and <strong>live communication</strong>. These topics interest me, mainly because I see them used in the real world and can think of <i>so</i> many applications in which they would be useful.</p>
