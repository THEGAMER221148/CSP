## My Blog

Hello, I am West Stefany, and this is my Computer Science Principles blog!

If you would like to know more about me, then please visit <a href="/student/about">my about page</a>

## Tools installation and Setup

### VSCode
To participate effectively in this class, I obviously needed an IDE that's better than notepad. So, I installed VSCode ony my Windows 11 computer! I added VSCode to my PATH and set it up and installed a few extensions including Python, Jupyter, LiveShare, GitLens, and GitHub Actions

### Cloning Repositories
I had to clone repositories on my machine to use github. I cloned them on a directory called "nighthawk" in a virtual environment through Ubuntu terminal. I then tried changing some things and pushing them to make sure everything was working properly.

### VENV (Virtual ENVironment)
To ensure things work across all devices and repositories, I had to set up a virtual environment where I would work with GitHub. I installed WSL to run Ubuntu as a virtual environment on my computer. VENV is also required for make t correctly function.

## Overall Progress

Here is some of my progress for this clas so far (weeks 1-4):
 - Installed nescecary tools (WSL, Ubuntu, VSCode + extensions, Python)
 - Set up my CSP personal repository

 - Made breakout hacks for my team
 - Wrote this blog!
 - Did some required hacks by Mr. Mortensen, like the jokes hack and background.
 - Other smaller tasks for collaboration and LxD
